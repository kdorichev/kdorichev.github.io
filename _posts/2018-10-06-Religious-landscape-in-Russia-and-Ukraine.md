This study was made as a part of [Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting/)
course by the University of Michigan. 

The task was to:
* find data related to religion in my area;
* visualize it using the best practices and principles of data visualization;
* use it to answer some questions.

Here are the results:

### Questions and answers

2. How many citizens in Ukraine called themselves Muslim?

### Some lesons learned
* Finding and cleaning the data takes much time.
* Data from [3] was in `SPSS` (`.sav`) format. I had to convert it into a .csv file with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
